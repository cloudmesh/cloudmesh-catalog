The WG will engage with scientists, academics, national
laboratories, such as synchrotrons, in securing, engineering,
curating, and publishing datasets and machine learning benchmarks that
operate on experimental scientific datasets. This will entail working
across different domains of sciences, including material, life,
environmental, and earth sciences, particle physics, and astronomy, to
mention a few. We will include traditional observational and
computer-generated data.

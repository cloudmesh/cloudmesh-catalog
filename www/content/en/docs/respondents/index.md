  Submitting the benchmark
{{% /pageinfo %}}


At the present time, we expect respondents to submit the results of
their run, and should provide justification in the form of documentation
(e.g., a technical manuscript or source code with run instructions). We
are exploring setting this up as a "pull request" based contribution
mechanism.

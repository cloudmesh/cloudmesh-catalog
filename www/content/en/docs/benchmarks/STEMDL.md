### STEMDL (Classification)

State of the art scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM)
produce focused electron beams with atomic dimensions and allow to
capture diffraction patterns arising from the interaction of incident
electrons with nanoscale material volumes. Backing out the local atomic
structure of said materials requires compute- and time-intensive
analyses of these diffraction patterns (known as convergent beam
electron diffraction, CBED). Traditional analyses of CBED requires
iterative numerical solutions of partial differential equations and
comparison with experimental data to refine the starting material
configuration. This process is repeated anew for every newly acquired
experimental CBED pattern and/or probed material.

In this [benchmark](https://github.com/at-aaims/stemdl-benchmark), we
used newly developed multi-GPU and multi-node electron scattering
simulation codes [\[1\]](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1631694-namsa) on
the Summit supercomputer to generate CBED patterns from over 60,000
materials (solid-state materials), representing nearly every known
crystal structure. A scaled-down version of this data
[\[2\]](https://doi.ccs.ornl.gov/ui/doi/70) is used for one of the data
challenges [\[3\]](https://smc-datachallenge.ornl.gov/challenge-2-2020/)
at SMC 2020 conference, and the overarching goals are to: (1) explore
the suitability of machine learning algorithms in the advanced analysis
of CBED and (2) produce a machine learning algorithm capable of
overcoming intrinsic difficulties posed by scientific datasets.

A [data](https://doi.ccs.ornl.gov/ui/doi/70) sample from this data set
is given by a 3-d array formed by stacking various CBED patterns
simulated from the same material at different distinct material
projections (i.e. crystallographic orientations). Each CBED pattern is a
2-d array with float 32-bit image intensities. Associated with each data
sample in the data set is a host of material attributes or properties
which are, in principle, retrievable via analysis of this CBED stack. Of
note are (1) 200 crystal space groups out of 230 unique mathematical
discrete space groups and (2) local electron density which governs
material's property.

This benchmark consists of 2 tasks: classification for crystal space
groups and reconstruction for local electron density, the example
implementation of which are provided in
[\[4\]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-63393-6_30)
and [\[5\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11150).

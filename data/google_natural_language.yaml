    Google Natural Language API is Google's solution for cloud-based NLP. It requires a Google Cloud account.
    The Natural Language API includes only the pre-configured models for common NLP functions, though Google
    also offers services specific to healthcare NLP as well as a code-free ML model manager called AutoML as
    part of Google Cloud.

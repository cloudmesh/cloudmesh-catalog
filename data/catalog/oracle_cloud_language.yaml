  description: |
    Oracle Cloud Language is Oracle's solution to cloud-based NLP.
    It is nested under the larger Oracle Cloud service. Unlike some other
    similar cloud NLP services, Oracle Cloud Language only supports English
    outside of its language detection function. Otherwise, it contains the common
    functions of classification, keyphrase extraction, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.

  description: |
    The Speech CLI is a command-line tool for using Speech service without having to write
    any code. The Speech CLI requires minimal setup. You can easily use it to experiment 
    with key features of Speech service and see how it works with your use cases. 
    Within minutes, you can run simple test workflows, such as batch speech-recognition 
    from a directory of files or text-to-speech on a collection of strings from a file. 
    Beyond simple workflows, the Speech CLI is production-ready, and you can scale it up
    to run larger processes by using automated .bat or shell scripts.

  description: |
    Einstein Language is Salesforce's solution to cloud-based NLP. It requires a Salesforce/Einstein account.
    It is under the umbrella of Einstein AI, which also includes Einstein Vision for image processing purposes.
    At the moment, Einstein Language only includes two main features, Intent and Sentiment.
    Intent analyzes meaning in text for the specific purpose of deciding market intent in customers.
    Sentiment is comparable to the classic sentiment detection provided by other NLP services.
